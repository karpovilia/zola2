* Project type: research.
* Result: github repo + arXiv paper.

marinetraffic.com provides you with information about vessels, that have their GPN enabled.
This data can be used to analyse current trade routes for different doods (like gas, wheat, etc...)
There is no research hypothesis yet, maybe this data can be combined with UN voting graph to check if economic influences politics or not.
